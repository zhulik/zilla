| Name | Type | Description | Notes |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- | ----- |
| **when_deleted** | **String** | WhenDeleted specifies what happens to PVCs created from StatefulSet VolumeClaimTemplates when the StatefulSet is deleted. The default policy of &#x60;Retain&#x60; causes PVCs to not be affected by StatefulSet deletion. The &#x60;Delete&#x60; policy causes those PVCs to be deleted. | [optional] |
| **when_scaled** | **String** | WhenScaled specifies what happens to PVCs created from StatefulSet VolumeClaimTemplates when the StatefulSet is scaled down. The default policy of &#x60;Retain&#x60; causes PVCs to not be affected by a scaledown.
